              <h2>What is SADD?</h2>
              <p>
                SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions) is a peer-to-peer education, prevention, and activism organization dedicated to preventing destructive decisions, particularly underage drinking, drug use, impaired driving, and other destructive decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Founded as Students Against Driving Drunk in 1981, SADD has grown to become the nation's premier youth health and safety organization with thousands of chapters in middle schools, high schools, and colleges across the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Great Neck South High School SADD Club is proud to be part of this national movement, working to empower our fellow students to make positive decisions in their lives.
